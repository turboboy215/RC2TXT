Song pointer table
===================
The song pointer table consists of 16-bit (2 byte) values. It can be found using the following code:

    ld [hl], $FF
    ld hl, $DD31
    inc [hl]
    ld hl, SongTable

Which equals the following in hex:
21 31 DD 34 21 ????

Song header
===================
Each song, which uses the same format for both music and sound effects, has a "header" which is stored as follows:
xx yyyy
  x (00-03) = SFX channel 1-4
  x (01-04) = Music channel 1-4
  y = Pointer
(Repeat for each channel)
FF = End of header

Song commands
===================
Song commands work as follows:
xy (00-BF) = Play note (or rest), length (X = length, Y = note)
(The higher the value of X, the shorter note length)
Cx = Select envelope?
Dx = Set volume/envelope
E0 xx yy = Set instrument, effect?
E1 xx = Set sweep/distortion effect
E2 xx = Set frequency
E3 = Set envelope bit values 1
E4 = Set envelope bit values 2
E5 = Set envelope bit values 3
E6 = Set envelope bit values 4
E7 = Set envelope bit values 5
E8 = Set envelope bit values 6
E9 xx = Set noise tone
EA xx = Set transpose
(80+ = negative)
EB = Set transpose +1 octave (+12)
EC = Set transpose -1 octave (-12)
ED-EF = Reset channels 1-4?
F0-F3 = Set panning options?
F4 xx = Set waveform
F5-F8 = Set channel speed value (F5 = 00, F6 = 0C, F7 = 18, F8 = 24)
F9 xxxx = Go to loop point
FA xxxx = Jump to position if done repeating
FB xx = Set repeat of section
FC xxxx = Go to repeat point
FD xxxx = Go to macro
FE = Exit macro
FF = End of track
